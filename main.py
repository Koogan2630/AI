A possible reason to this is that the mutation chance is too high thus resulting in too many increase in value . In addition to the already large initial values set on the first generation, there is no chance for it to be useful as there is no average reduction in the value . For the other two mutations, as this is tested multiple times the second mutations provides a more reliable mutation for the genetic algorithm")
